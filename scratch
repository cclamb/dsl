syntax like this?

p = Policy.new(Logic.Sequential) do
	activity :a1 do
		constraint :c1 do
			pass
		end
		constraint :c2 do
			pass
		end
		obligation :o1 do
			fail
		end
	end
end

or with an option
* do we want to allow untagged activities?
* no, but untagged constraints etc. are okay

p = Policy.new(Logic.Sequential) do
	activity :a1 do
		constraint do
			pass
		end
		constraint do
			pass
		end
		obligation do
			fail
		end
	end
end

and default to sequential
* see above about activities

p = Policy.new do
	activity :a1 do
		constraint do
			pass
		end
		constraint do
			pass
		end
		obligation do
			fail
		end
	end
end
